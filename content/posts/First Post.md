Developing in public.

Welcome to the start of my blog. The point of this isn\'t really to show
off my knowledge surrounding technologies or the weird projects I have
been up to. Quite the contrary. The point of this blog is to work on my
own writing abilities as well as showcase some of the things I have been
working on.

I have no doubts that the reader of this blog, *you*, will have far more
knowledge and experience than myself and probably played around with the
idea before. On the off chance this isn\'t the case I hope you have
learned something and that my posts provide some entertainment value.

Most of this blog will provide a journey of the skills that I acquire
from the various projects I work on, whether they be hardware, software,
academic or, on the rare occasion, creative. These will genearlly be in
the format of posting an article or series of articles of me expressing
an interest, in the previously mentioned categories, coupled with the
best explanations of why I did what did, why it works that way, and how
would I improve it.
